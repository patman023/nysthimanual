## Jacks

Here's the color coding for the Jacks, so that you can understand what kind of signals work best where! 

Both the Standard and Buchla variants are included.

Audio: Periodic signals above 2 Hz

Control Voltage (CV): Signals typically between +/-10 V, used to control parameters of a module. Examples include LFOs and Envelopes (but can be literally anything! EXPERIMENT!).

Gate: A Pulse Wave of +10 V with a variable duration. Think of a key on a keyboard being held (turning it on) and released (which turns it off). 

Pulse/Trigger: A +10 V signal, typically with a duration of 1 ms (older modules with the 0.1 ms duration are being updated)
