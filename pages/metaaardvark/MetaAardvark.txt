metaAARDVARK

Antonio sais:

---- it's an attempt to obtain a super set of the RVG cell from the Warren Burt famous work "Aardvark IV"
---- http://www.warrenburt.com/my-history-with-music-tech2/
---- it's an LFO CLOCK S&H NOISE PULSE generator
---- contains a simulated R-2R resistor network (a vintage DAC) with deviations due to resistors tolerances (between 0% to 20%)
---- the deviations are recomputed every time the module is initialized or the DEV% param is changed
---- the simulated R-2R is from 1 bit (2 values) to 10 bits (1024 values)
---- values are subdivision of 10V
--- the OUTPUTS ARE:
---- STEPPED = (SAMPLED VALUE * INNER GAIN) + INNER OFFSET
---- SMOOTHED = PORTAMENTO(STEPPED)
---- PULSE = STEPPED > COMPARATOR ? PULSE OUT : NOTHING;
------ PARAMETERS

-------- SECTION 2: CLOCK HZ DISPLAYS
---------- CLICK and DRAG display to set frequency of the pulse/sampler from 0.01Hz to 8kHz

---------- CLK FM CV + CV VCA to modulta the inner CLOCK
-------- SECTION 4: VOLTAGE OFFSET
---------- CLICK and DRAG display to set VOLTAGE OFFSET from -15v to +15v

---------- CLICK and DRAG display to set PORTAMENTO from 0.0 to 1.0
---------- CV IN and VCA to modulate the PORTAMENTO
-------- SECTION 7: RESOLUTION
---------- CLICK and DRAG display to set resolution from 1 bit to 10bits (from 2 to 1024 values)
---------- CLICK and DRAG display to set the DEVIATION of resistors of the simulated DAC (from 0 % to 20% tolerance)
-------- SECTION 8: OUT
---------- STEPPED OUT the current value selected for the current resolution with OFFSET and GAIN
---------- SMOOTHED OUT the current STEPPED OUT value filtered by PORTAMENTO
---------- PULSE OUT uses a COMPARATOR (knob) settable from 0.01v to 9.99v;
----------- when the selected value is higher than KNOB a PULSE is emitted

1) It's a Clock

The top part is the Clock out (Section A)

    From left to right
    
    Pulse out
    Square out
    Ramp Up out
    Ramp Down out
    
    The Pulse out always emits 0.0001 seconds long pulses
    
    While you can set the frequency below (Section B) to audio rate, the resulting audio will be very aliased due to simple LFO (naive Antonio calls it),
    so this is best used at LFO rates  and not an audio rate modulator
   
   
Underneath that there are two digital displays, this is the clock frequency (red is internal clock, green is external clock) (Section B)
   
    The red one is a draggable display, the further left the cursor is clicked and dragged in the display, the faster it will adjust up or down.
   
    The green one shows either:
   
        If no external Clock signal is patched into Clock in (Section C)  the it shows the currently adjusted one (same as the draggable one)
        If an external Clock signal is patched into Clock in (Section C) then it shows the currently detected frequency of pulses
       

Below that is the Clock in (Section C)

	 Clock input to the left, and Clock FM CV input with attenuator
	
	

2) It's a Voltage Offset device (Section D)

	It can either:
	
	    Output a set voltage offset, configurable via the draggable display (red)
	
	    Output a CV controllable offset if the CV input at left with attenuator is patched ,tracked on green display
	    
	    
3) It's a VCA for what is output (Section E)

	This can either:
	
	  Output a set amount of Gain (-1 to +1) to apply to the outputs 
	  
	  Output a CV controllable amount of Gain via CV input at left with attenuator, tracked by the green display
	  
	  
4) It can apply Portamento (from 0% to 100%) (Section F)

    It affects the smooth output only and can be set either
    
      Set by clicking and dragging in the red display
      
      Controlled by CV via input jack at left with attenuator
      
      
5) It is a Sample & Hold unit (Section G)

     It can hold 1-10 bits (2 Values to 1024 values). The creator of the hardware version of this (linked above near top) asked Antonio to emulate the vintage DAC as faithfully as possible,
     meaning it had to be able to also emulate the  up to 20% variability of the hardware, so here we have a variability of 0% to 20%, user settable. The default is 2% variability.
     This means that if, for example, you set the network to 1 bit and variability to 2% then, if the varibilty deviates from the 2 possible values of (for this example) 0 V and 5V, with 20% the 0v could move between -1v to +1v and the 5v between 4v and 6v.
     
     The values are all draggable to set as wished
     
     
6) The Outputs (Section H)

	From left to right
	
	Stepped voltage output, which is sampled value +gain +offset and goes from 0v to 10v (the blue line on the scope)
	
    Pulse out with Comparator (the attenuator above the output going from 0.01v to 9.99v)
     
        Only if sampled voltage is higher than Comparator setting it outputs a pulse on this output
        The Pulse out always emits 0.0001 seconds long pulses
        
    Smooth output is current stepped output voltage filtered by the Portamento setting (the pink line on the scope)
    
    
================================================================================================================================

Usage:

*All red displays can be clicked and dragged up/down to set. The further left you click the faster it changes*

- Use the Clock outputs (Section A) to modulate/trigger other modules

- No Clock in patched in (Section C) uses the internal clock (settable in Section B via red display)) 
	- To vary speed over time feed a slow sine LFO into the Clock FM CV input and attenuate to taste with the pod to it's left.
	
- External Clock patched in (Section C) overrides internal clock. Green display (Section B) tracks the incoming frequency
	- To vary speed over time feed a slow sine LFO into the Clock FM CV input and attenuate to taste with the pod to it's left
	- If your clock pulse is irregular this can make for some very unstable mess with all the Clock outs in Section A.
	
- Use the Stepped/Smooth/Pulse outs at bottom (Section H) to trigger stuff and generate pitch CV to feed your oscillators with. 
     - Might need some attenuation/attenuvertion to tame the range/offset
     - Play with the Comparator pod above the Pulse out to get the trigger outs you want
     
- Plug something into everything and see what happens ;)
